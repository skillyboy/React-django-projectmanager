    ## Overview
    
    This is a Project Management application that provides both API and frontend implementations. The app allows users to manage projects with various attributes, ensuring an efficient workflow and organization.
    
    ## Features
    
    The application supports the following project attributes:
    
    - **Status**: Represents the current state of the project.
      - In Progress
      - Done
      - Abandoned
      - Canceled
    
    - **Priority**: Indicates the urgency of the project.
      - Low
      - Mid
      - High
    
    - **Name**: The title of the project.
    - **Description**: A detailed explanation of the project.
    - **Assigned to**: User ID of the person assigned to the project.
    - **Created by**: User ID of the person who created the project.
    - **Date Created**: Timestamp indicating when the project was created.
    
    ## User Roles and Permissions
    
    - **Admin**: Can create, update, delete, and assign projects to users.
    - **User**: Can view projects assigned to them.
    
    The application includes permission management for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on projects.
    
    ## Validation and Error Handling
    
    The app is equipped with input validation and error handling to ensure data integrity and provide user-friendly error messages.
    
    ## Models
    
    The application utilizes Django's built-in models to manage the project data. You can customize the models as needed for your specific use case.
    
    ## Admin Interface
    
    The application leverages Django's built-in admin UI for managing projects. To access the admin interface, follow these steps:
    
    1. Create a superuser if you haven't already:
       ```bash
       python manage.py createsuperuser
       ```
    
    2. Run the server:
       ```bash
       python manage.py runserver
       ```
    
    3. Navigate to the admin panel at [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/) and log in with your superuser credentials. Here, you can create, update, delete, and assign projects to users.
    
    ## Frontend Implementation
    
    The frontend is designed to interact with the API endpoints created, considering the different user types (Admin and User). Users can view and manage their assigned projects seamlessly.
    
    ## Django Ninja
    
    This application leverages **Django Ninja**, a modern web framework for building APIs with Django, which allows for easy and efficient development of RESTful APIs.
    
    ## Docker Setup
    
    To run the application in a Docker container, follow these steps:
    
    ### Prerequisites
    
    - Docker
    - Docker Compose
    
    ### Dockerfile
    
    Hereâ€™s the `Dockerfile` used to set up the application:
    
    ```dockerfile
    FROM python:3.9
    
    # Set the working directory.
    WORKDIR /app
    
    # Copy the requirements file and install dependencies.
    COPY requirements.txt .
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
    
    # Copy the rest of the application code.
    COPY . .
    
    # Expose the port the app runs on.
    EXPOSE 8000
    
    # Run the command to start the app.
    CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
    ```
    
    ### Building and Running the Docker Container
    
    1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
       ```bash
       git clone <your-repo-url>
       cd <your-project-folder>
       ```
    
    2. Build the Docker image:
       ```bash
       docker build -t project-management-app .
       ```
    
    3. Run the Docker container:
       ```bash
       docker run -p 8000:8000 project-management-app
       ```
    
    4. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000`.
    
    ## API Documentation

    ### Input Validation
    
    Each API request includes validation to ensure that all required fields are present and correctly formatted.
    
    ### API Documentation Link
